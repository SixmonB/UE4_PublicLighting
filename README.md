# UE4_PublicLighting

This VR simulation was developed for the Noz Breizh project from the Universite de la Bretagne Occidentale in Brest, France, as a research in the impact of public lighting on people's feeling of safety. For confidentiality issues, I can't share the whole code but I got permission to show the build scene. I uploaded the project to my personal Mega folder (Github LFS didnt work for this project and I had to find a way around it) and you can get the executable files + documentation on how to use the version we prepared for the chosen study case.

The goal of the project was to reduce light and energy consumption in public spaces in the city of Brest. To do that, it was necessary to study the influence of artificial light on people, animals, insects and plants. For the study on humans we carried out two stages of research, both simulations are in the folder. The first one is called "Test Bas de Siam Game" and it consisted of a scene that looked like a portion of the city center, in order to provide a familiar environmennt for the test participant, to then change the light intensity and record results. The main conclusion from this research was that people would be affected by the fact that they feel safe in known areas so even if light is dim, that doesnt make them feel unsafe. To avoid this situation, we moved on to stage two and created a whole new environment and use it to test reactions. My part on the project finished before this test part but I can also link the report of the first stage, which was also presented in the WellComp2022 Workshop in Ubicomp Conference.
