# UE4_PublicLighting

This simulation was developed for the Noz Breizh project froma the Universite de la Bretagne Occidentale in Brest, France, as a research in the impact of public lighting on people's feeling of safety. For confidentiality issues, I can't share the whole code but I got permission to show the build scene. I uploaded the project to my personal Mega folder and you can get the executable files + documentation on how to use the version we prepared for the chosen study case.
